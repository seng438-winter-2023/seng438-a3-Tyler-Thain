# 1 Introduction

In this lab our group looked back on Assignment 2 and used a new coverage tool EclEmma to determine the coverage. We then made new unit tests in order to increase the total coverage and reported the results 

** Please note the EclEmma does not have condition coverage so we used method coverage instead **

For rangeTest, the initial statement coverage was 35.3%, branch coverage was 35.4%, and method coverage was 47.8%.
